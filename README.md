### IMDb Clone Project Overview
I developed an IMDb clone utilizing the MERN stack, enhanced with Bootstrap for layout and custom CSS for styling. This application replicates the core functionalities of IMDb, allowing users to manage their movie listings effectively.

# Technology Stack
**Backend:** MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
**Frontend:** React.js, Bootstrap

# Key Features

**User Authentication:** Implemented user registration and login functionality, incorporating JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication. This allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their movie listings.

**My Movie Listings:** Once logged in, users gain access to a dedicated "My Movie Listing" tab. This section displays movies created by the user, allowing them to view, update, edit, or delete their entries easily.

**Actor and Producer Management:** Users can add actors and producers to the database, establishing relationships between movies, actors, and producers. This functionality is designed to enhance the movie listing experience and create a more interconnected database.

**Form Validation:** I implemented validation for various forms, including the Movie Form, Add Producer Form, and Add Actor Form. This ensures that user inputs are correct and comply with the specified criteria before submission.
